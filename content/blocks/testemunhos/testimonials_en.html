                The curriculum was carefully planned and covered all the essential areas of data analysis, machine learning, and programming skills. 
                The professors were highly knowledgeable and passionate, and they were patient and understanding, especially considering my limited coding experience. 
                I must also mention that ISA itself is a remarkably beautiful place to study. The campus and its surroundings create a peaceful and motivating environment for learning. 
                I feel fortunate to be a part of such a vibrant academic community, where classmates and other individuals at ISA have been incredibly supportive and inspiring.

                thanks to the teachers and the well-structured curriculum. The combination of theoretical and practical classes allowed me to acquire the knowledge
                needed quickly, in addition to being able to apply data from my area of study in the work and projects we are developing.
                I am pleased to have chosen this master's degree, as it opened up new opportunities that I am sure will appear in the future, in addition to
                which is closely linked to all types of Food Industry and beyond. I recommend it to all those who are curious to know how
