    <p>The importance of training in data science has been highlighted for its role in the economy and society, improving data-driven decision support. Globally, the demand for data scientists is high, with insufficient supply for the needs of the labor market.</p>
    
    <p>In the areas of application of this master's degree, there has been a growing adoption of technologies and practices based on the intensive use of data, in addition to what has already existed in some areas for years (e.g. environment).</p>
    
    <p>The new master's degree <em><strong>Data Science in Agriculture, Food, Forest and Environment</strong></em> aims to enable, through theoretical and practical training, the application of Data Science to food production systems, environmental quality management and natural resources.</p>
    
    <p>The Master Talk about the <span class="green-ds-name">Green Data Science</span> took place on 21th Mar 2024. It includes the presentation of the master's degree, and, from the 11th minute onwards, the testimony of two students, InÃªs Silveira (Environment Eng.) and Vasco Florentino (Landscape Architect).
