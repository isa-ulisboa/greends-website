      forest inventory processes for cork oak and holm oak species identification and assessment</h3>

    <p>Forest management plays a vital role in ensuring sustainable ecosystems and resources, yet traditional forest
      inventory processes are often time-consuming and resource-intensive. Forest inventories, which involve gathering
      and analyzing data on forest areas, are central to sustainable forest management efforts.</p>

    <p>While modern inventories have begun integrating advanced technological tools such as Geographic Information
      Systems (GIS), there remains a critical need to optimize these processes, particularly in regions where resources
      for extensive fieldwork are limited. The AGROGES company faces significant challenges in efficiently managing
      forest inventories for cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak (Quercus ilex) species.</p>

    <p>Traditional methods rely heavily on manual fieldwork and statistical analysis, making the process costly and
      time-consuming. The need for accurate tree counting, species differentiation, crown area calculation, and health
      assessment requires a more efficient and scalable approach. In this Hackathon, the challenge was to develop a
      Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model capable of analyzing geospatial data to achieve multiple
      forest management objectives: assessing tree numbers in plots, accurately mapping the presence of both oak
      species, differentiating between cork oak and holm oak trees, calculating individual tree crown areas for resource
      assessment, and evaluating tree health and condition to inform sustainable management practices.</p>
