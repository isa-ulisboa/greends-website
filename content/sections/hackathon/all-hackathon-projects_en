					<span class="truncate-text">Forest management plays a vital role in ensuring sustainable ecosystems and
						resources, yet traditional forest inventory processes are often time-consuming and resource-intensive.
						Forest inventories, which involve gathering and analyzing data on forest areas, are central to sustainable
						forest management efforts. While modern inventories have begun integrating advanced technological tools such
						as Geographic Information Systems (GIS), there remains a critical need to optimize these processes,
						particularly in regions where resources for extensive fieldwork are limited. The AGROGES company faces
						significant challenges in efficiently managing forest inventories for cork oak (Quercus suber) and holm oak
						(Quercus ilex) species. Traditional methods rely heavily on manual fieldwork and statistical analysis,
						making the process costly and time-consuming. The need for accurate tree counting, species differentiation,
						crown area calculation, and health assessment requires a more efficient and scalable approach. In this
						Hackathon, the challenge was to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) deep learning model capable of
						analyzing geospatial data to achieve multiple forest management objectives: assessing tree numbers in plots,
						accurately mapping the presence of both oak species, differentiating between cork oak and holm oak trees,
						calculating individual tree crown areas for resource assessment, and evaluating tree health and condition to
						inform sustainable management practices.</span>

					<span class="truncate-text">Wildfires pose a significant national challenge for Portugal due to their
						unpredictable nature and the multitude of variables involved. Research indicates that while most fires are
						controlled early, a small percentage that escape initial attack cause the majority of damage and burnt area.
						Fires that escape the critical initial 90-minute window require firefighters to deploy additional resources
						and strategies for control, often leading to larger and more devastating events. The ability to predict
						these scenarios is crucial for improving decision-making and resource management in real-time. Building upon
						the foundation established by the 2023 hackathon team, who successfully created an application that predicts
						which fires to prioritize using an XGBoost machine learning model, this project focused on addressing key
						limitations in data quantity, data pipeline quality, and prediction tool application. The challenge was
						particularly complex as it required handling three distinct data types: meteorological data (dynamic),
						spatial data (static), and fire occurrence data, while ensuring the system could be continuously updated to
						maintain accuracy. In this Hackathon, the team was tasked with enhancing the existing wildfire prediction
						system by adding new data sources, improving the data collection process for continuous model updates, and
						developing a secondary model that operates without first-time fire support arrival information. The project
						involved creating automated scripts for weekly data updates, cleaning, and preparation, with the goal of
						optimizing the entire pipeline from data collection to application deployment. Given that Portugal's
						wildfire season typically begins in July and lasts approximately 15 weeks, the enhanced system was designed
						to update annually before fire season, with suggested data refreshes in May.</span>

					<span class="truncate-text">Water management for irrigation represents one of the most critical challenges in
						sustainable agriculture, particularly in Portugal where water resources require careful conservation and
						optimization. Decades of valuable research data on water needs for key crops have been collected, but this
						information often remains scattered across fragmented datasets, making it difficult for farmers, irrigation
						technicians, and public administrators to access and apply this knowledge effectively in their daily
						operations. The complexity of irrigation data, combined with the diverse needs of different stakeholders,
						creates a significant barrier between scientific research and practical field application. Farmers need
						clear, actionable insights to make informed decisions about when and how much to irrigate, while maintaining
						sustainable practices that conserve water resources. The challenge extends beyond data access to encompass
						the need for intuitive tools that can translate complex scientific information into practical guidance for
						irrigation management. In this Hackathon, the challenge was to develop the irrig.ISA platform, a
						comprehensive solution that addresses these challenges through three core approaches: organizing decades of
						fragmented research datasets into a coherent and unified structure compatible with modern data frameworks;
						creating interactive dashboards and visualizations tailored to meet diverse user needs; and ensuring the
						platform aligns with practical requirements of end users across different sectors. The project aimed to
						democratize access to critical irrigation data, streamline complex datasets into visually intuitive formats,
						and promote sustainable resource management by enabling precise irrigation practices that reduce water waste
						and enhance long-term agricultural resilience.</span>

					<span class="truncate-text">Eucalyptus plantations represent a cornerstone of Portugal's forestry sector, with
						Eucalyptus globulus covering approximately 845,000 hectares and constituting 26.2% of the Portuguese forest.
						These plantations serve as the primary raw material source for the pulp and paper industry, one of the
						country's most important economic sectors. However, defoliation caused by the Eucalyptus weevil (Gonipterus
						platensis) poses a persistent and severe threat to plantation productivity and ecosystem health. The
						Eucalyptus weevil, accidentally introduced to Portugal in 1995, rapidly became a major pest with larvae and
						adults feeding on newly flushed leaves, shoots, and buds, causing trees to lose apical dominance and
						significantly decreasing wood productivity. Despite biological control efforts using the parasitoid Anaphes
						nitens, the effectiveness varies dramatically with environmental conditions, particularly temperature and
						elevation. Research shows that parasitism rates drop from 70-95% at low elevations to 0-25% above 600-700m
						altitude, while winter temperatures below 10¬∞C result in ineffective biological control. The economic impact
						is substantial, with weevil-induced damage causing wood losses of 648 million euros over the past 20 years
						in Portugal. In this Hackathon, the challenge was divided into two interconnected problems addressing
						critical gaps in eucalyptus pest management. The first problem focused on developing predictive models for
						defoliation levels based on environmental and management variables, enabling decision-makers to anticipate
						risks, prioritize regions for monitoring and intervention, and optimize resource allocation for pest control
						while minimizing environmental impacts. The second problem involved analyzing temperature data from
						2009-2011 to understand how meteorological factors affect population dynamics between the weevil and its
						parasitoid, providing insights crucial for improving biological control strategies and determining optimal
						conditions for natural enemy effectiveness.</span>

					<span class="truncate-text">Portugal is a country that has been severely affected by fires in recent decades,
						which generate high social, economic and environmental impacts. There are several factors that contribute to
						this reality: (1) territory with high rural abandonment, which combined with the low profitability of rural
						spaces, creates a flammable landscape, with high continuity and quantity of fuel; (2) favorable weather
						conditions, especially during summer, aggravated by climate change; (3) a high number of ignitions promoted
						by a culture of negligent use of fire. The fires that generate the largest burned area and negative impacts
						are usually concentrated in a period of 10-15 days. This fact introduces complexity into fire management,
						since large fires are often accompanied by simultaneity (i.e. several occurrences occurring at the same
						time) and high geographic dispersion across the national territory. In this context, fire suppression
						management is a complex task that requires knowledge, tools and concerted efforts from all involved. This
						must take into account the environmental conditions that influence the development of fires, but also the
						spatial, temporal and capacity heterogeneity of resources available for fighting. In order to improve the
						forest fire fighting system, it is important to increase the effectiveness of its response. This improvement
						may involve the promotion of anticipatory measures, which promote more effective management of resources,
						maintaining the balance of the combat system (i.e. avoiding its collapse). The possibility of predicting the
						type of event, based on the analysis of the history of occurrences, is an important element in supporting
						resource management decisions. In this Hackathon, the challenge is to predict the probability of a new
						forest fire event escaping the initial attack that allows it to be extinguished in 90 minutes, given the
						terrain and meteorological conditions associated with the occurrence. The aim is also to identify which
						factors determine a forest fire to escape this initial attack. For this project, historical data on
						occurrences in Portugal since 2018 is used, including operational data, meteorological data and geographic
						data. Team Members Ant√≥nio Lacerda, Benjamin Hilliger, Christoph Fischer, In√™s Silveira, Joana Esteves,
