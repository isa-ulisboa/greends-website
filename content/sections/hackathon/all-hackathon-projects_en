					<span class="truncate-text">Predicting the quantity of fruits that can be harvested weekly is
						essential to support the daily management of red fruit production in greenhouses. This value is
						important for planning the allocation of human resources necessary to carry out the harvest,
						predicting the quantity of fruit delivered to customers. In the case of red fruits, which cannot
						be stored and have a short shelf life, the accuracy of this prediction is essential. The Summer
						Berry Company (TSBCo) group produces small fruits throughout the year. Production is carried out
						in greenhouse tunnels, which allow stable conditions for plant growth. However, not all
						environmental factors can be controlled, especially meteorological ones. This may have
						implications for the speed of fruit development and quantity produced at each time. In this
						Hackathon, the challenge was launched to create a short and medium-term prediction model for the
						quantity of raspberries harvested. The project bases its analysis on the history of data
						collected by the company on agricultural holdings, which includes, among others, production
						data, characterization of crop phenological parameters, meteorological and environmental data.

					<span class="truncate-text">Portugal is a country that has been severely affected by fires in recent
						decades, which generate high social, economic and environmental impacts. There are several
						factors that contribute to this reality: (1) territory with high rural abandonment, which
						combined with the low profitability of rural spaces, creates a flammable landscape, with high
						continuity and quantity of fuel; (2) favorable weather conditions, especially during summer,
						aggravated by climate change; (3) a high number of ignitions promoted by a culture of negligent
						use of fire. The fires that generate the largest burned area and negative impacts are usually
						concentrated in a period of 10-15 days. This fact introduces complexity into fire management,
						since large fires are often accompanied by simultaneity (i.e. several occurrences occurring at
						the same time) and high geographic dispersion across the national territory. In this context,
						fire suppression management is a complex task that requires knowledge, tools and concerted
						efforts from all involved. This must take into account the environmental conditions that
						influence the development of fires, but also the spatial, temporal and capacity heterogeneity of
						resources available for fighting. In order to improve the forest fire fighting system, it is
						important to increase the effectiveness of its response. This improvement may involve the
						promotion of anticipatory measures, which promote more effective management of resources,
						maintaining the balance of the combat system (i.e. avoiding its collapse). The possibility of
						predicting the type of event, based on the analysis of the history of occurrences, is an
						important element in supporting resource management decisions. In this Hackathon, the challenge
						is to predict the probability of a new forest fire event escaping the initial attack that allows
						it to be extinguished in 90 minutes, given the terrain and meteorological conditions associated
						with the occurrence. The aim is also to identify which factors determine a forest fire to escape
						this initial attack. For this project, historical data on occurrences in Portugal since 2018 is
						used, including operational data, meteorological data and geographic data. Team Members António
						Lacerda, Benjamin Hilliger, Christoph Fischer, Inês Silveira, Joana Esteves, Johanna Rauberger,
