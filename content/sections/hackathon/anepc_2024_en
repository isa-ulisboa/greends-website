      models for prioritizing wildfire response to improve real-time decision-making and resource management</h3>

    <p>Wildfires pose a significant national challenge for Portugal due to their unpredictable nature and the multitude
      of variables involved. Research indicates that while most fires are controlled early, a small percentage that
      escape initial attack cause the majority of damage and burnt area.</p>

    <p>Fires that escape the critical initial 90-minute window require firefighters to deploy additional resources and
      strategies for control, often leading to larger and more devastating events. The ability to predict these
      scenarios is crucial for improving decision-making and resource management in real-time. Building upon the
      foundation established by the 2023 hackathon team, who successfully created an application that predicts which
      fires to prioritize using an XGBoost machine learning model, this project focused on addressing key limitations in
      data quantity, data pipeline quality, and prediction tool application.</p>

    <p>The challenge was particularly complex as it required handling three distinct data types: meteorological data
      (dynamic), spatial data (static), and fire occurrence data, while ensuring the system could be continuously
      updated to maintain accuracy. In this Hackathon, the team was tasked with enhancing the existing wildfire
      prediction system by adding new data sources, improving the data collection process for continuous model updates,
      and developing a secondary model that operates without first-time fire support arrival information.</p>

    <p>The project involved creating automated scripts for weekly data updates, cleaning, and preparation, with the goal
      of optimizing the entire pipeline from data collection to application deployment. Given that Portugal's wildfire
      season typically begins in July and lasts approximately 15 weeks, the enhanced system was designed to update
      annually before fire season, with suggested data refreshes in May.</p>
