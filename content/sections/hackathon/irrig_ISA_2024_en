      irrigation research data into an accessible platform that optimizes water management and supports sustainable
      agricultural practices in Portugal</h3>

    <p>Water management for irrigation represents one of the most critical challenges in sustainable agriculture,
      particularly in Portugal where water resources require careful conservation and optimization. Decades of valuable
      research data on water needs for key crops have been collected, but this information often remains scattered
      across fragmented datasets, making it difficult for farmers, irrigation technicians, and public administrators to
      access and apply this knowledge effectively in their daily operations. The complexity of irrigation data, combined
      with the diverse needs of different stakeholders, creates a significant barrier between scientific research and
      practical field application. Farmers need clear, actionable insights to make informed decisions about when and how
      much to irrigate, while maintaining sustainable practices that conserve water resources.</p>

    <p>The challenge extends beyond data access to encompass the need for intuitive tools that can translate complex
      scientific information into practical guidance for irrigation management. In this Hackathon, the challenge was to
      develop the irrig.ISA platform, a comprehensive solution that addresses these challenges through three core
      approaches: organizing decades of fragmented research datasets into a coherent and unified structure compatible
      with modern data frameworks; creating interactive dashboards and visualizations tailored to meet diverse user
      needs; and ensuring the platform aligns with practical requirements of end users across different sectors.</p>

    <p>The project aimed to democratize access to critical irrigation data, streamline complex datasets into visually
      intuitive formats, and promote sustainable resource management by enabling precise irrigation practices that
      reduce water waste and enhance long-term agricultural resilience.</p>
