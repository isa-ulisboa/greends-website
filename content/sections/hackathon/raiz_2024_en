      defoliation levels and analyze temperature effects on pest-parasitoid dynamics to optimize forest management and
      biological control strategies</h3>

    <p>Eucalyptus plantations represent a cornerstone of Portugal's forestry sector, with Eucalyptus globulus covering
      approximately 845,000 hectares and constituting 26.2% of the Portuguese forest. These plantations serve as the
      primary raw material source for the pulp and paper industry, one of the country's most important economic sectors.
      However, defoliation caused by the Eucalyptus weevil (Gonipterus platensis) poses a persistent and severe threat
      to plantation productivity and ecosystem health. The Eucalyptus weevil, accidentally introduced to Portugal in
      1995, rapidly became a major pest with larvae and adults feeding on newly flushed leaves, shoots, and buds,
      causing trees to lose apical dominance and significantly decreasing wood productivity.</p>

    <p>Despite biological control efforts using the parasitoid Anaphes nitens, the effectiveness varies dramatically
      with environmental conditions, particularly temperature and elevation. Research shows that parasitism rates drop
      from 70-95% at low elevations to 0-25% above 600-700m altitude, while winter temperatures below 10°C result in
      ineffective biological control.</p>

    <p>The economic impact is substantial, with weevil-induced damage causing wood losses of 648 million euros over the
      past 20 years in Portugal. In this Hackathon, the challenge was divided into two interconnected problems
      addressing critical gaps in eucalyptus pest management.</p>

    <p>The first problem focused on developing predictive models for defoliation levels based on environmental and
      management variables, enabling decision-makers to anticipate risks, prioritize regions for monitoring and
      intervention, and optimize resource allocation for pest control while minimizing environmental impacts.</p>

    <p>The second problem involved analyzing temperature data from 2009-2011 to understand how meteorological factors
      affect population dynamics between the weevil and its parasitoid, providing insights crucial for improving
      biological control strategies and determining optimal conditions for natural enemy effectiveness.</p>
