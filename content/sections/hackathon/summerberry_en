		<p>Predicting the quantity of fruits that can be harvested weekly is essential to support the daily
			management of red fruit production in greenhouses. This value is important for planning the allocation
			of human resources necessary to carry out the harvest, predicting the quantity of fruit delivered to
			customers. In the case of red fruits, which cannot be stored and have a short shelf life, the accuracy
			of this prediction is essential.</p>

		<p> The Summer Berry Company (TSBCo) group produces small fruits throughout the year. Production is
			carried out in greenhouse tunnels, which allow stable conditions for plant growth. However, not all
			environmental factors can be controlled, especially meteorological ones. This may have implications
			for the speed of fruit development and quantity produced at each time.</p>

		<p> In this Hackathon, the challenge was launched to create a short and medium-term prediction model for
			the quantity of raspberries harvested. The project bases its analysis on the history of data collected
			by the company on agricultural holdings, which includes, among others, production data,
			characterization of crop phenological parameters, meteorological and environmental data.</p>
