		<h2>Being a partner of Green Data Science.<span class="text-muted"> Strengthening the connection of Data Science
				with companies and entities.</span></h2>

		<p>By being a partner of <span>Green Data Science</span>, entities or companies can contribute to the training
			of professionals prepared to solve real problems in the areas of Master's training. This allows
			organizations to advance more quickly in the ongoing digital transformation, allowing the challenges of
			management and data analysis of their production and management processes to be the focus of attention
			during the practical training of the master. Graduates of <span>Green Data Science</span> will, therefore,
			be able to immediately contribute to the improvement and efficiency gains that data science can provide.
			Partners can collaborate in several ways:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Provide use cases for Hackathon Project</li>
			<li>Presenting Seminars on Data Science activity and experience</li>
			<li>Hosting internships or dissertations</li>
			<li>Providing the training of its employees</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="en-4 pb-3">Introduce us your use case to be a subject of a <strong>Hackathon Project</strong></h3>

		<p>In <strong>Hackathon Project</strong>, students carry out a project proposed by partner companies, as a
			hackathon. Teams are formed to develop the different phases of the data science methodology, from problem
			formulation, to data acquisition and management, data visualization and analysis, modeling and application
			of machine learning methods, and story telling of the use case. The entities that present the use case
			follow-up the project as specialists, contributing to the presentation and analysis of the problem, and to
			the validation of the solution.</p>
			
		<h4 class="pt-3 pb-3">What is needed to present a <strong>Hackaton Project</strong> proposal?</h4>

		<p>For a successful Hackathon Project, the proposal must be associated with:
			<ul>
			<li>A problem within the scope of data science. If you have doubts about the suitability of the problem, <a
			href="https://www.isa.ulisboa.pt/ensino/mestrados/mcdaafa/lp/en/partners-proposals">contact us</a>;
			</li>
			<li>A set of pre-existing data. The data does not need to be organized, which can one of the
			hackathon goals/deliverables;</li>
			<li>The availability to play the role of an expert on the topic of the problem, to monitor the project and validate the
			results;</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

		<p>Each Hackathon project lasts 8 to 12 weeks, and includes at least one initial workshop and one
			final workshop.
			During the hackathon, teams work in a remote environment, but with heavy use of online tools for
			code sharing, documentation, discussion and meeting. Progress and planning is assessed through
			weekly meetings.
			The work is monitored by a professor or researcher from ISA, and by a mentor from the partner entity.

			<h3 class="pt-4 pb-3">Participate in <strong>Seminars</strong> integrated into the curricular units</h3>

			<p>Experience and application is very important to our students. Through the presentation of a Seminar,
				integrated in the curricular units of our course, we want to promote contact between students and
				professionals from different areas of application, promoting know-how through their expertise.</p>

			<p><a class="btn btn-outline-secondary"

					type="button">Submit a seminar topic</a></p>

			<h3 class="en-4 pb-3">Host internships or dissertations</h3>

			<p>Hosting internships or dissertations provides opportunities for innovation through the creation of new
				knowledge and its application. This graduation phase allows you to explore problems, test pilots or
				support the implementation of solutions, in a context of strong proximity between the university
				environment and the business reality. There is, therefore, a high potential for gain on the part of
				partners who propose to host internships or dissertations, benefiting from the transfer of technology or
				knowledge adjusted to the reality of their processes.</p>

			<h3 class="pt-4 pb-3">Providing postgraduate training for its employees</h3>

			<p>The Green Data Science Master gives special attention to lifelong learning. The course schedule is mixed,
				making it possible to carry out training while maintaining professional activity. Additionally, the
				strong hands-on component of data science subjects allows students to test this learning against their
				own interests and application needs. By enabling the training of their employees, companies or entities
				not only contribute to the enhancement of their staff, but also enable the acquisition of knowledge
				adjusted to their specific needs.</p>
